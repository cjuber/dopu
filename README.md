This project is a drop-off / pick-up app for a preschool.  
A parent will register with their email address and add any children they might drop off at the school. They will just need to sign in and check which children they are dropping off.  Then when they are ready to pick up the children they will sign in again and select the children they are picking up. The app will record the time they were dropped off and picked up.  Then it will add the price per hour to their total balance. It will also handle enrollments into classes and add the tuition to their balance as well.
